## Black-box testing: Model-based Software Testing

### Create a password entry / CRUD

#### Use case

Managing password entries is a critical functionality of this project. It's therefore critical that we perform model-based testing to verify the correctness of the UI. The user will need to add, edit and delete passwords from the application.

### Search for a specific entry

#### Use case

After introducing the password in the application, the user will want to search for the password to use on a specific website. They should be able to search either by the name of the website or by the URL.

### Clipboard

#### Use case

The main goal of this application is to help the user store and use their passwords easily and safely.
To avoid the need to edit an entry to copy information from it, the application provides the user with clipboard utilities
capable of instantly copying the URL, the username or the password of the user.
Verifying that these utilities are working correctly using only unit tests can be quite tricky, making this functionality a good candidate for model-based testing.

### QF-Test Feedback

We felt that the QF-Test tool is pretty good and the installation process was straightforward. We didn't manage to add the tool to `PATH` with the setup tool, so we resorted to finding the executable in the project's files and executing it using the terminal. We feel that this part of the user experience could be improved upon.

The tool felt very intuitive to use.
